          <p>While most children in nursery and primary school will be potty trained by the time they start formal schooling, there can still be occasional accidents or regressions. Even if your child is already potty trained at home, there may be adjustments needed for the school environment. This blog is here to equip you with the knowledge and resources to navigate potty training with confidence!</p>

          <h2>Signs Your Child Might Be Ready</h2>
          <p><ul>
            <li><b>Physical Development:</b> Your child has good bladder and bowel control, and can stay dry for at least 2 hours during the day.</li>
            <li><b>Communication Skills:</b> They can communicate their needs verbally or through gestures, and understand simple instructions related to using the potty.</li>
            <li><b>Increased Independence:</b> They show interest in dressing and undressing themselves, and a desire to do things on their own.</li>
          </ul></p>

            <li><b>Patience and Consistency:</b> Accidents are inevitable. Be patient, reassuring, and consistent with your approach.</li>
            <li><b>Practice Makes Perfect:</b> Let your child practice sitting on the potty, even if they don't go at first.</li>
